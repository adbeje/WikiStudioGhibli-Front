            <h2 id="startH2">Studio Ghibli</h2>
            <p>
              Studio Ghibli Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio
              headquartered in Koganei, Tokyo.[1] The studio is best known for
              its animated feature films, and has also produced several short
              films, television commercials, and one television film. The
              studio's mascot and most recognizable symbol is the character,
              Totoro, a giant cat-like spirit from the studio's 1988 film My
              Neighbor Totoro. Studio Ghibli's highest grossing films include
              Spirited Away (2001), Ponyo (2008), and Howl's Moving Castle
              (2004). The studio was founded on June 15, 1985 by directors Hayao
              Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the
              success of Topcraft's anime film Nausicaä of the Valley of the
              Wind (1984). Studio Ghibli has also collaborated with video game
              studios on the visual development of several video games. Five of
              Studio Ghibli's films are among the 10 highest-grossing anime
              films made in Japan, with Spirited Away being number two, grossing
              over US$380 million worldwide. Many of their works have won the
              Animage Anime Grand Prix award, and four have won the Japan
              Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of Studio Ghibli's
              films have received Academy Award nominations. Spirited Away won
              the Golden Bear in 2002 and the Academy Award for Best Animated
              Feature Film in 2003. On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli temporarily
              halted production, following the retirement of Miyazaki. In
              February 2017, Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of
              retirement again to direct a new feature film, How Do You Live?.

            <h3 id="nameH3">Name</h3>
            <p>
              The name "Ghibli" was chosen by Miyazaki from the Italian noun
              ghibli, based on the Libyan Arabic name for hot desert wind (قبلي,
              'ghiblī'), the idea being the studio would "blow a new wind
              through the anime industry". It also refers to an Italian
              aircraft, the Caproni Ca.309. Although the Italian word would be
              more accurately transliterated as 'Giburi' (ギブリ), with an hard
              g sound, the studio is romanised in Japanese as 'Jiburi' (ジブリ).

            <p>
              Founded on June 15, 1985, the studio was headed by directors Hayao
              Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and producer Toshio Suzuki. Prior to
              the formation of the studio, Miyazaki and Takahata had already had
              long careers in Japanese film and television animation and had
              worked together on The Great Adventure of Horus, Prince of the Sun
              in 1968 and the Panda! Go, Panda! films in 1972 and 1973, and in
              1978, Suzuki became an editor at Tokuma Shoten's Animage manga
              magazine, where the first film he chose was Horus. A year after
              his phone call with Takahata and his first encounter with
              Miyazaki, both about Horus, he made a phone call about the first
              film Miyazaki ever directed: The Castle of Cagliostro. The studio
              was founded after the success of the 1984 film Nausicaä of the
              Valley of the Wind, written and directed by Miyazaki for Topcraft
              and distributed by Toei Company. The origins of the film lie in
              the first two volumes of a serialized manga written by Miyazaki
              for publication in Animage as a way of generating interest in an
              anime version. Suzuki was part of the production team on the film
              and founded Studio Ghibli with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata
              to join the new studio. The studio has mainly produced films by
              Miyazaki, with the second most prolific director being Takahata
              (most notably with Grave of the Fireflies). Other directors who
              have worked with Studio Ghibli include Yoshifumi Kondō, Hiroyuki
              Morita, Gorō Miyazaki, and Hiromasa Yonebayashi. Composer Joe
              Hisaishi has provided the soundtracks for most of Miyazaki's
              Studio Ghibli films. In their book Anime Classics Zettai!, Brian
              Camp and Julie Davis made note of Michiyo Yasuda as "a mainstay of
              Studio Ghibli’s extraordinary design and production team". At one
              time the studio was based in Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo. In
              August 1996, The Walt Disney Company and Tokuma Shoten formed a
              partnership wherein Walt Disney Studios would be the sole
              international distributor for Tokuma Shoten's Studio Ghibli
              animated films. Under this agreement, Disney also agreed to
              finance 10% of the studio's production costs. Since then, all
              three aforementioned films by Miyazaki at Studio Ghibli that were
              previously dubbed by Streamline Pictures have been re-dubbed by
              Disney. On June 1, 1997, Tokuma Shoten Publishing consolidated its
              media operations by merging Studio Ghibli, Tokuma Shoten
              Intermedia software and Tokuma International under one location.
              Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio
              Ghibli and the magazine Animage, which regularly runs exclusive
              articles on the studio and its members in a section titled "Ghibli
              Notes." Artwork from Ghibli's films and other works are frequently
              featured on the cover of the magazine. Saeko Himuro's novel Umi ga
              Kikoeru was serialised in the magazine and subsequently adapted
              into Ocean Waves, Studio Ghibli's only animated feature-length
              film created for television. It was directed by Tomomi Mochizuki.
              In October 2001, the Ghibli Museum opened in Mitaka, Tokyo. It
              contains exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows
              animations, including a number of short Studio Ghibli films not
              available elsewhere. The studio is also known for its strict
              "no-edits" policy in licensing their films abroad due to Nausicaä
              of the Valley of Wind being heavily edited for the film's release
              in the United States as Warriors of the Wind. The "no cuts" policy
              was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein
              suggested editing Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable. A
              Studio Ghibli producer is rumoured to have sent an authentic
              Japanese sword with a simple message: "No cuts".
            </p>
            <h4 id="secondEraH4">Independent era</h4>
            <p>
              Between 1999 and 2005, Studio Ghibli was a subsidiary brand of
              Tokuma Shoten; however, that partnership ended in April 2005, when
              Studio Ghibli was spun off from Tokuma Shoten and was
              re-established as an independent company with relocated
              headquarters. On February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from
              the position of Studio Ghibli president, which he had held since
              2005, and Koji Hoshino (former president of Walt Disney Japan)
              took over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve films with his own
              hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his
              employees. Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino
              because Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli to sell its videos since
              1996 and has also aided the release of the Princess Mononoke film
              in the United States. Suzuki still serves on the company's board
              of directors. Two Studio Ghibli short films created for the Ghibli
              Museum were shown at the Carnegie Hall Citywise Japan NYC
              Festival: "House Hunting" and "Mon Mon the Water Spider" were
              screened on March 26, 2011. Takahata developed a project for
              release after Gorō Miyazaki's (director of Tales from Earthsea and
              Hayao's son) The Tale of the Princess Kaguya – an adaptation of
              The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter. The last film Hayao Miyazaki
              directed before retiring from feature films was The Wind Rises
              which is about the Mitsubishi A6M Zero and its founder. On Sunday,
              September 1, 2013, Hayao Miyazaki held a press conference in
              Venice to confirm his retirement, saying: "I know I've said I
              would retire many times in the past. Many of you must think, 'Once
              again.' But this time I am quite serious." On January 31, 2014, it
              was announced that Gorō Miyazaki will direct his first anime
              television series, Sanzoku no Musume Rōnya, an adaptation of
              Astrid Lindgren's Ronia the Robber's Daughter for NHK. The series
              is computer-animated, produced by Polygon Pictures, and
              co-produced by Studio Ghibli. In March 2014, Toshio Suzuki retired
              as producer and assumed the new position of general manager.
              Yoshiaki Nishimura replaced Suzuki in the producer role. On August
              3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take a
              "brief pause" to re-evaluate and restructure in the wake of
              Miyazaki's retirement. He stated some concerns about where the
              company would go in the future. This led to speculation that
              Studio Ghibli will never produce another feature film again. On
              November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, "That was not my intention,
              though. All I did was announce that I would be retiring and not
              making any more features." Lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura among
              several other staffers from Ghibli, such as director Hiromasa
              Yonebayashi, left to found Studio Ponoc in April 2015, working on
              the film Mary and the Witch's Flower. The 2016 animated fantasy
              film The Red Turtle, directed and co-written by Dutch-British
              animator Michaël Dudok de Wit in his feature film debut, was a
              co-production between Studio Ghibli and Wild Bunch. In February
              2017, Toshio Suzuki announced that Hayao Miyazaki had come out of
              retirement to direct a new feature film with Studio Ghibli. On
              November 28, 2017, Koji Hoshino stepped down as president; he was
              replaced by Kiyofumi Nakajima (former Ghibli Museum director).
              Hoshino was then appointed as Chairman of Studio Ghibli. In May
              2020, Toshio Suzuki confirmed that a new film from Gorō Miyazaki
              is in development at Studio Ghibli. On June 3, 2020, Studio Ghibli
              announced that the film would be an adaptation of the novel Earwig
              and the Witch by Diana Wynne Jones. The film was announced as the
              first full 3D CG animated Ghibli film and slated for a television
              premiere on NHK in late 2020.
